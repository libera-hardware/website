# [Libera #hardware](ircs://irc.libera.chat:6697##hardware)

## An Libera IRC community for all your computer hardware questions.

### Channel Rules
- User-sourced benchmarks (such as PassMark) are not reliable comparison tools and are not to be treated as such. 
- No religion, politics, cryptocurrency talk, or unfair discrimination. 
- Admin problems? Join us in [#hardware-ops](ircs://irc.libera.chat:6697#hardware-ops).

### Channel Policies

- Chronic help vampires may be removed from the community.

We define a Help Vampire as:

    A Help Vampire problem is the idea that some users will continually ask the same tired
    questions in the hope that someone else will do their work for them, irrespective of
    whether the same question has already been asked or whether they could easily find
    the solution elsewhere.

Other symptoms include:

    Will continue to extend the original question with continued questions, even after the
    original question has been well answered.

    Provides just a brief and vague overview about the problem, omitting vital information,
    and assumes that answerers are able to grok the context of the poster's problem, as if
    they were asking their team lead the problem directly.

    Will attempt to pester an answerer with continued questions several days later, on 
    unrelated matters.

    And once they've sucked every last ounce of life from you, will then disappear without
    so much as a thanks.
